Use Lenis or Locomotive Scroll for smooth scroll

Parallax background layers (city silhouette, gradient waves)

Floating icons in hero (soft oscillation)

Carousel motion with inertia and drag constraints

Dark mode transitions with soft fade

🧠 UX Design Philosophy

Minimal friction: users can reach their goal (search / join / discover) in 2 clicks.

Motion = meaning: each animation guides the eye.

Local feel, global quality: integrate Egyptian cultural hints (colors, typography, small details) while keeping a Silicon Valley-grade polish.

Accessibility: ARIA labels, large contrast ratios, bilingual screen-reader labels.
